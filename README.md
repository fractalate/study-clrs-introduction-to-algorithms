## Python

Setting up a Python virtual environment, from the root of this project:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install dependencies:

```
pip install jupyter matplotlib numpy scipy
```

When returning to the project, activate your Python virtual environment again:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Notebooks are distributed throughout the proejct, so you can open up Jupyter in the root of this project:

```
jupyter notebook
```
